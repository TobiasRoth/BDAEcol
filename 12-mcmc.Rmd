# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation {#mcmc}


## BACKGROUND
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques were developed in the mid-1950s by physicists (Metropolis et al., 1953). Later, statisticians discovered MCMC (Hastings, 1970; Geman & Geman, 1984; Tanner & Wong, 1987; Gelfand et al., 1990; Gelfand & Smith, 1990). MCMC methods make it possible to obtain posterior distributions for parameters and latent variables (unobserved variables) of complex models. In parallel, personal computer capacities increased in the 1990s and user-friendly software such as the different programs based on the programming language BUGS (Spiegelhalter et al., 2003) came out. These developments boosted the use of Bayesian data analyses, particularly in genetics and ecology.
