# Posterior Predictive Model Checking and Proportion of Explained Variance {#predictivemodcheck}


## POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE MODEL CHECKING

### Why Mixed Effects Models?
Only if the model describes the data-generating process sufficiently accurately can we draw relevant conclusions from the model. It is therefore essential to assess model fit: our goal is to describe how well the model fits the data with respect to different aspects of the model. In this book, we present three ways to assess how well a model reproduces the data-generating process: (1) residual analysis (Chapter 6), (2) posterior predictive model checking (this chapter) and (3) prior sensitivity analysis (Chapter 15).
