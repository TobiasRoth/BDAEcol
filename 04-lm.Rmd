## LINEAR REGRESSION

### Background
Linear regression is the basis of a large part of applied statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be considered special cases of linear regression, and generalized linear models are extensions of linear regression. We, therefore, start with a rather detailed introduction to linear regression.
