# Generalized Linear Mixed Models {#glmm}


## BINOMIAL MIXED MODEL

### Background
To illustrate the binomial mixed model we have adapted a data set used by Gr√ºebler et al. (2010) on barn swallow Hirundo rustica nestling survival (we have selected a nonrandom sample to be able to fit a simple model; hence, the results do not add unbiased knowledge about the swallow biology!). For 63 swallow broods, we know the clutch size and the number of the nestlings that fledged. The broods came from 51 farms, thus some of them had more than one brood. There are three predictors measured at the level of the farm: colony size (the number of swallow broods on that farm), cow (whether there are cows on the farm or not), and dung heap (the number of dung heaps, piles of cow dung, within 500 m of the farm).
