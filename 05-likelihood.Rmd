# Likelihood {#likelihood}


## THEORY
As described in Section 3.2, in Bayesian statistics the likelihood is the prob- ability distribution of the data given the model p(yjq), also called the pre- dictive density. In contrast, frequentists use the likelihood as a relative measure of the probability of the data given a specific model (i.e., a model with specified parameter values). Often, we see the notation L(qjy) 1⁄4 p(yjq) for the likelihood of a model. Let’s look at an example. According to values that we found on the internet, black-tailed prairie dogs, Cynomys ludovicianus, weigh on average 1 kg with a standard deviation of 0.2 kg.
