# Daily nest survival {#dailynestsurv}

## Background

Analyses of nest survival is important for understanding the mechanisms of population dynamics. The life-span of a nest could be used as a measure of nest survival. However, this measure very often is biased towards nests that survived longer because these nests are detected by the ornithologists with higher probability [@Mayfield1975]. In order not to overestimate nest survival, daily nest survival conditional on survival to the previous day can be estimated. 


## Models for estimating daily nest survival

What model is best used depends on the type of data available. Data may look:  

1. Regular (e.g. daily) nest controls, all nests monitored from their first egg onward  
2. Regular nest controls, nests found during the course of the study at different stages and nestling ages  
3. Irregular nest controls, all nests monitored from their first egg onward  
4. Irregular nest controls, nests found during the course of the study at different stages and nestling ages  



Table: (\#tab:nestsurvmod) Models useful for estimating daily nest survival. Data numbers correspond to the descriptions above.

Model   | Data          | Software, R-code       | 
:-------|:------------------|:------------------|
Binomial or Bernoulli model | 1, (3)  |  `glm`, `glmer`,...  |  
Cox proportional hazard model | 1,2,3,4  | `brm`, soon: `stan_cox` |  
Known fate model  | 1, 2  | Stan code below |  
Known fate model  | 3, 4 | Stan code below |  




## Known fate model

A natural model that allows estimating daily nest survival is the known-fate survival model. It is a Markov model that models the state of a nest $i$ at day $t$ (whether it is alive, $y_{it}=1$ or not $y_{it}=0$) as a Bernoulli variable dependent on the state of the nest the day before.  
$$ y_{it} \sim Bernoulli(y_{it-1}S_{it})$$
The daily nest survival $S_{it}$ can be linearly related to predictor variables that are measured on the nest or on the day level.

$$logit(S_{it}) = \textbf{X} \beta$$
It is also possible to add random effects if needed.


## The Stan model {#dailynestsurvstan}
The following Stan model code is saved as `daily_nest_survival.stan`.


```stan
data {
  int<lower=0> Nnests;                  // number of nests
  int<lower=0> last[Nnests];            // day of last observation (alive or dead)
  int<lower=0> first[Nnests];           // day of first observation (alive or dead)
  int<lower=0> maxage;                  // maximum of last
  int<lower=0> y[Nnests, maxage];       // indicator of alive nests
  real cover[Nnests];                 // a covariate of the nest
  real age[maxage];                   // a covariate of the date
}

parameters {
  vector[3] b;                          // coef of linear pred for S
}

model {
  real S[Nnests, maxage-1];             // survival probability
                
  for(i in 1:Nnests){  
    for(t in first[i]:(last[i]-1)){ 
      S[i,t] = inv_logit(b[1] + b[2]*cover[i] + b[3]*age[t]); 
    }
  }

  // priors
  b[1]~normal(0,5);
  b[2]~normal(0,3);
  b[3]~normal(0,3);  
  b[4]~normal(0,3);

  // likelihood
  for (i in 1:Nnests) {
    for(t in (first[i]+1):last[i]){
      y[i,t]~bernoulli(y[i,t-1]*S[i,t-1]);
    }
  }
}

```



## Prepare data and run Stan


Data is from @Grendelmeier2018. 



```r
load("RData/nest_surv_data.rda")
str(datax)
```

```
## List of 7
##  $ y     : int [1:156, 1:31] 1 NA 1 NA 1 NA NA 1 1 1 ...
##  $ Nnests: int 156
##  $ last  : int [1:156] 26 30 31 27 31 30 31 31 31 31 ...
##  $ first : int [1:156] 1 14 1 3 1 24 18 1 1 1 ...
##  $ cover : num [1:156] -0.943 -0.215 0.149 0.149 -0.215 ...
##  $ age   : num [1:31] -1.65 -1.54 -1.43 -1.32 -1.21 ...
##  $ maxage: int 31
```

```r
datax$y[is.na(datax$y)] <- 0  # Stan does not allow for NA's in the outcome
```


```r
# Run STAN
library(rstan)

mod <- stan(file = "stanmodels/daily_nest_survival.stan", data=datax, 
            chains=5, iter=2500, control=list(adapt_delta=0.9), verbose = FALSE)
```


## Check convergence

We love exploring the performance of the Markov chains by using the function `launch_shinystan` from the package `shinystan`. 

## Look at results
It looks like cover does not affect daily nest survival, but daily nest survival decreases with the age of the nestlings.


```r
#launch_shinystan(mod)
print(mod)
```

```
## Stan model 'daily_nest_survival' does not contain samples.
