# Bayesian Data Analysis in Ecology with R and Stan

## Content of the repository
There is a single rmarkdon file for each chaper of the book. Otherwise the repositoriy contains also the following folders.

### RData
This folder contains some of the data that we use in the book. The data files are storred as `.RData` files that can be directly loaded into R using the funtion `load()`. By convention the name of the file is also the name of the R-object that will be loaded. E.g. using `load("RData/elevation.RData")` will load a tibble named elevation.
