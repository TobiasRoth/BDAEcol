## MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
Every statistical model makes assumptions. We try to build models that reflect the data-generating process as realistically as possible. However, a model never is the truth. Yet, all inferences drawn from a model, such as estimates of effect size or derived quantities with credible intervals, are based on the assumption that the model is true. However, if a model captures the data- generating process poorly, for example, because it misses important struc- tures (predictors, interactions, polynomials), inferences drawn from the model are probably biased and results become unreliable. In a (hypothetical) model that captures all important structures of the data generating process, the sto- chastic part, the difference between the observation and the fitted value (the residuals), should only show random variation. Analyzing residuals is a very important part of the data analysis process.
