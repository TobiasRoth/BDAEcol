## DATA ANALYSIS STEP BY STEP
This checklist can give some guidance for data analysis. However, the list is not complete. For specific studies, a different order of the steps may make more sense or further data structures not considered here may need to be checked. We usually repeat steps 2 to 7 until we find one or a set of models that fit the data well and that are realistic enough to be useful for the intended purpose. Data analysis is always a lot of work and, often, the following steps have to be repeated many times until we find a useful and robust model. There is a danger with this: we may find interesting results that answer different questions than we asked originally.
