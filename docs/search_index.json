Content Notations Acknowledgments Further reading", " Data Analysis in Ecology with R and Stan Fr채nzi Korner-Nievergelt and Tobias Roth 2018-08-13 Preface Why this book? In 2015, we wrote a statistics book for Master/PhD level Bayesian data analyses in ecology (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). You can order it here. People seemed to like it (e.g. (Harju 2016)). Since then, two parallel processes happen. First, we learn more and we become more confident in what we do, or what we do not, and why we do what we do. Second, several really clever people develop software that broaden the spectrum of ecological models that now easily can be applied by ecologists used to work with R. With this e-book, we open the possibility to add new or substantially revised material. In most of the time, it should be in a state that it can be printed and used together with the book as handout for our stats courses. It is open so that everybody with a GitHub account can make comments and suggestions for improvement. We are looking forward to your contribution! Content We do not copy text from the book into the e-book. Therefore, we refer to the book (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015) for reading about the basic theory on doing Bayesian data analyses using linear models. However, Chapters 1 to 17 of this dynamic e-book correspond to the book chapters. In each chapter, we may provide updated R-codes and/or additional material. The following chapters contain completely new material that we think may be useful for ecologists. Notations It is unavoidable that different authors use different notations for the same thing, or that the same notation is used for different things. We try to use, whenever possible, notations that is commonly used at the International Statistical Ecology Congress ISEC. Resulting from an earlier ISEC, Thomson et al. (2009) give guidelines on what letter should be used for which parameter in order to achieve a standard notation at least among people working with classical mark-recapture models. However, the alphabet has fewer letters compared to the number of ecological parameters. Therefore, the same letter cannot stand for the same parameter across all papers, books and chapters. Here, we try to use the same letter for the same parameter within the same chapter. Acknowledgments We thank Yihui Xie for providing bookdown which makes is much fun to write open books such as ours. Further reading A really good introductory book to Bayesian data analyses is (McElreath 2016). This book starts with a thorough introduction to applying the Bayes theorem for drawing inference from data. In addition, it carefully discusses what can and what cannot be concluded from statistical results. We like this very much. We like looking up statistical methods in papers and books written by Andrew Gelman (e.g. (Gelman et al. 2014)) and Trevor Hastie (e.g. (T. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009, Efron and Hastie (2016))) because both explain complicated things in a concise and understandable way. For further reading recommendations, see (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). Siehe auch Fig. 2.1. "],

["PART-II.html", "4 Introduction to PART II 4.1 Further reading", " 4 Introduction to PART II During our courses we are sometimes asked to give an introduction to some R-related stuff covering data analysis, presentation of results or rather specialist topics in ecology. In this part we present collected these introduction and try to keep them updated. This is also a commented collection of R-code that we documented for our own work. We hope this might be useful olso for other readers. 4.1 Further reading R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham: Introduces the tidyverse framwork. It explains how to get data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. Geocomputation with R: This book is aimed at people who want to do spatial data analysis, visualization and modeling using open source software and reproducible workflows. "],

With R Markdown, you can easily create reproducible data analysis reports, presentations, dashboards, interactive applications, books, dissertations, websites, and journal articles, while enjoying the simplicity of Markdown and the great power of R and other languages. Bookdown by Yihui Xie: A guide to authoring books with R Markdown, including how to generate figures and tables, and insert cross-references, citations, HTML widgets, and Shiny apps in R Markdown. The book can be exported to HTML, PDF, and e-books (e.g. EPUB). The book style is customizable. You can easily write and preview the book in RStudio IDE or other editors, and host the book wherever you want (e.g. bookdown.org). Our book is written using bookdown. "],
