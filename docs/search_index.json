In 2015, we wrote a statistics book for Master/PhD level Bayesian data analyses in ecology (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). People seemed to like it (e.g. (Harju 2016)). Since then, two parallel processes happen. First, we learn more and we become more confident in what we do, or what we do not, and why we do what we do. Second, several really clever people develop software that broaden the spectrum of ecological models that now easily can be applied by ecologists used to work with R. With this e-book, we open the possibility to add new or substantially revised material. In most of the time, it should be in a state that it can be printed and used together with the book as handout for our stats courses. It is open so that everybody with a GitHub account can make comments and suggestions for improvement. We are looking forward to your contribution! 1.2 What is the content of this dynamic e-book? We do not copy text from the book into the e-book. Therefore, we refer to the book (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015) for reading about the basic theory on doing Bayesian data analyses using liner models. However, chapters 1 to 17 correspond to the book chapters. In each chapter, we may provide updated R-codes and/or additional material. The following chapters contain completely new material that we think may be useful for ecologists. Further reading in Bayesian data analysis Eldredge “Statistical rethinking” introduces the Bayes theorem and the bases in statistics in a very understandable and insightful way. Hastie’s Bayes Book…. Gelman and Hill (2007) teach Bayesian data analysis using linear models in a very creative way, with examples from the social and political sciences. Kruschke (2011) gives a thorough and very understandable introduction to Bayesian data analysis. McCarthy (2007) concisely introduces Bayesian methods using WinBUGS. Kéry (2010) gives an introduction to linear models using Bayesian methods with WinBUGS. Stauffer (2008) works practically through common research problems in the life sciences using Bayesian methods. Faraway (2005, 2006) and Fox and Weisberg (2011) provide applied introductions to linear models using frequentist methods in R. Note that there is an extensive erratum to Faraway (2006) on the web. Zuur et al. (2009, 2012) are practical and understandable introductions to linear models in R with a particular focus on complex real ecological data problems such as nonindependent data. Zuur et al. (2012) also introduce Bayesian methods. A more theoretical approach, including R code, is Aitkin et al. (2009). We can also recommend the chapters introducing generalized linear models in Wood (2006). "]
