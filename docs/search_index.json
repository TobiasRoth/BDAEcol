Further reading in Bayesian data analysis", " 1 What is this dynamic e-book about? 1.1 Why did we start this dynamic e-book? In 2015, we wrote a statistics book for Master/PhD level Bayesian data analyses in ecology (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). People seemed to like it (e.g. (Harju 2016)). Since then, two parallel processes happen. First, we learn more and we become more confident in what we do, or what we do not, and why we do what we do. Second, several really clever people develop software that broaden the spectrum of ecological models that now easily can be applied by ecologists used to work with R. With this e-book, we open the possibility to add new or substantially revised material. In most of the time, it should be in a state that it can be printed and used together with the book as handout for our stats courses. It is open so that everybody with a GitHub account can make comments and suggestions for improvement. We are looking forward to your contribution! 1.2 What is the content of this dynamic e-book? We do not copy text from the book into the e-book. Therefore, we refer to the book (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015) for reading about the basic theory on doing Bayesian data analyses using linear models. However, Chapters 1 to 17 of this dynamic e-book correspond to the book chapters. In each chapter, we may provide updated R-codes and/or additional material. The following chapters contain completely new material that we think may be useful for ecologists. Further reading in Bayesian data analysis A really good introductory book to Bayesian data analyses is (McElreath 2016). This book starts with a thorough introduction to applying the Bayes theorem for drawing inference from data. In addition, it carefully discusses what can and what cannot be concluded from statistical results. We like this very much. We like looking up statistical methods in papers and books written by Andrew Gelman (e.g. (Gelman et al. 2014)) and Trevor Hastie (e.g. (T. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009, Efron and Hastie (2016))) because both explain complicated things in a concise and understandable way. For further reading recommendations, see (F. Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). "],
["basics.html", "2 Introduction to statistical thinking and working with R 2.1 Notations", " 2 Introduction to statistical thinking and working with R 2.1 Notations It is unavoidable that different authors use different notations for the same thing, or that the same notation is used for different things. We try to use, whenever possible, notations that is commonly used at the International Statistical Ecology Congress ISEC. Resulting from an earlier ISEC, Thomson et al. (2009) give guidelines on what letter should be used for which parameter in order to achieve a standard notation at least among people working with classical mark-recapture models. However, the alphabet has fewer letters compared to the number of ecological parameters. Therefore, the same letter cannot stand for the same parameter across all papers, books and chapters. Here, we try to use the same letter for the same parameter within the same chapter. "],
