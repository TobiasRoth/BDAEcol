## HIERARCHICAL MULTINOMIAL MODEL TO ANALYZE HABITAT SELECTION USING BUGS
Categorical response variables are quite common in ecological studies. For example, when studying habitat selection of animals, the outcome variable often is one of several habitat types in which an animal is observed at different time points. Questions can be about whether the animal uses the different habitat types proportional to their availability in its home range, whether the use of the habitat types differs between the sexes or between young and adult animals, or whether the use of habitat types is affected by any covariate such as weather or age of the animal. The statistical methods used to analyze habitat selection with respect to such questions are manifold. They range from simple preference indices to complicated multivariate methods (see overview in Manly et al., 2002) or compositional analysis (Aebischer & Robertson, 1993).
