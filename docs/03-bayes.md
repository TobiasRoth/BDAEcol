# The Bayesian and the Frequentist Ways of Analyzing Data {#bayes}

## SHORT HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
Reverend Thomas Bayes (1701 or 1702e1761) developed the Bayes theorem. Based on this theorem, he described how to obtain the probability of a hy- pothesis given an observation, that is, data. However, he was so worried whether it would be acceptable to apply his theory to real-world examples that he did not dare to publish it. His methods were only published posthumously (Bayes, 1763). Without the help of computers, Bayesâ€™ methods were appli- cable to just simple problems.
