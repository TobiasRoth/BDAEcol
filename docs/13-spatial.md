## BACKGROUND

### Why Mixed Effects Models?
The first law of geography says: “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” (Tobler, 1970). Statisticians call this phenomenon spatial autocorrelation. It can be seen as a simple 2D generalization of temporal autocorrelation, which describes the tendency of two things nearer to each other along the time axis to be more similar than things further apart in time. Legendre (1993) proposed a more formal defi- nition: “The property of random variables taking values, at pairs of locations a certain distance apart, that are more similar (positive autocorrelation) or less similar (negative autocorrelation) than expected for randomly associated pairs of random observations”. Some common examples of spatial autocorrelation in ecology are patchiness, gradients, or regular distributions.
